# Lightweight Material Design 3 Razor Components for Blazor

Materia.Blazor is a lightweight  component library for [ASP.NET Blazor](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet/web-apps/blazor) 
that is rigorously faithful to the [Material Design 3](https://m3.material.io/) design philosophy, markup and code usage.

There are links to the comprehensive API reference automatically generated from the Materia.Blazor codebase's triple slash comments For each of the `Materia.Blazor` and `Materia.Blazor.Internal` namespaces.
As a user of the library, you should only reference the `Materia.Blazor` namespace. `Materia.Blazor.Internal` as its name suggests has components intended only for the library's internal use.
